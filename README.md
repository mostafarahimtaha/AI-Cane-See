# AI CANE SEE
This project discusses features of technological solutions for enabling the visually impaired
and blind people to travel in outdoor environments without the help of others. One
of the main obstacles that the visually impaired suffer from is the unavailability of the
blind sticks that discovers obstacles and alerts the blind. Our research aims to devise a
smart cane to assist the blind in motion by using micro-controller (Raspberry Pi) and
other components such as ultrasonic sensors. The main constituents of the independent
travel are object detection and awareness.
The research has two parts: the first part is about image processing by the use of
deep learning algorithms and techniques, in order to inform the user what the object
in front of him is and the distance between the user and the obstacle. We used deep
learning to get more accuracy, as sometimes it exceeds the human-level performance.
We also used deep learning as we believe that embedded systems by itself does not
provide a smart enough system, we will explain why throughout our researches. In deep
learning, we train the computer model by providing it a huge amount of labeled data
and different neural network architectures. Deep learning consists of back propagation,
activation functions, output layers, input layers, and hidden layers. The second part
is the implementation where three ultrasonic sensors were used which detect obstacles
that face the user from three different directions by alerting him/her using vibration and
buzzer. This thesis is focused on the support for individuals with visual impairments to
navigate indoors and outdoors.
